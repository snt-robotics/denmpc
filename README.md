## Outline
DENMPC is providing an object-oriented real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework which has been developed at the Automation & Robotics Research Group http://wwwde.uni.lu/snt/research/automation_robotics_research_group at the University of Luxembourg. 

The basic idea of DENMPC is to provide a fast nonlinear MPC that can adjust at runtime to different systems.
This refers to: 
*   Multi-agent systems that can change tasks, objectives and topology
*   Fault-tolerant control, where the controller has to adapt to different system conditions
*   Control prototyping, where you want to explore different scenarios without creating the underlying Optimal Control Problem (OCP) from scratch

In order to do so, DENMPC features an object-oriented modularization approach.
This allows structuring the control scenario into agents, constraints and couplings.
Out of these single components, DENMPC is dynamically creating the OCP at runtime.
As a result, agents, constraints and couplings can be added, removed, and parameters can be changed at runtime. This addition, respectively subtraction is triggered by events
which can be for example timer events, ROS-messages events, etc.
For very complex tasks, this can further be used to combine step chains with DENMPC,
to specialize the MPC for each task stage individually.

## DENMPC features:

    Nonlinear model predictive control (e.g. a quadrotor with nonlinear system dynamics)
    Central control of single-agent systems (e.g. a single robot)
    Central control of multi-agent systems (e.g. multiple robots that are interacting)
    Object-oriented code to easily adapt it:
        Controller: Interface class for implementations of controllers, e.g.CMSCGMRES
        Agent: Interface class for implementations of agents, respective system or robot types, e.g. Quadrotor
        Constraint: Interface class for implementations of single-agent constraints
        Coupling: Interface class for implementations for coupling agents 
    Open-source code 


## Installation

    # Navigate to your ROS catkin workspace (e.g. catkin_ws):`
    cd catkin_ws/src
    #Clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/DentOpt/denmpc.git
    cd ..
    #Build package
    catkin_make

### To use the AR.Drone 2.0 scenario with the tum simulator
Install:

    cd catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/DentOpt/ardrone_simulator_gazebo7.git
    cd ..
    catkin_make

To run the AR.Drone 2.0 scenario in gazebo, run

    roslaunch cvg_sim\_gazebo ardrone_testworld.launch 

Launch drone (Takeoff) from commandline: 

    rostopic pub -1 /ardrone/takeoff std_msgs/Empty

The AR.Drone 2.0 simulator is configured to subscribe control commands under the topic "/cmd_vel".
The AR.Drone 2.0 pose is published under "/pose"


To control the AR.Drone 2.0 in with denmpc:
either to track center of UAV:

    rosrun denmpc scenario_ardrone_pose_tracking_node
 
 or to track with sensor constraint:
 
    rosrun denmpc scenario_ardrone_sensor_tracking_node
 
 and to send desired pose use rqt or commandline, e.g 
 
    rostopic pub /desiredpose geometry_msgs/PoseStamd '{header: {stamp: now, frame_id: "map"}, pose: {position: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 2.0}, orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}}}'

### To use the Turtlebot scenario
Install:

    cd catkin_ws/src
    sudo apt-get install
    git clone https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git #Install Turtlesim
    git clone https://github.com/DentOpt/denmpc.git -b tutorial_turtlesim  #Install DENMPC branch
    cd ..
    catkin_make

Run:

    roscore #run roscore
    rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node #Run Turtlesim in separate tab
    rosrun denmpc scenario_scenario_node #Run denmpc in separate tab

That's it!
You will see how the turtle DENMPC moves from its initial position to the position x=1 y=1.
You can give any desired position by publishing it to the /turtle1/desiredpose.
For example, for the new target x=5, y=5 type
`rostopic pub /turtle1/desiredpose turtlesim/Pose "{x: 5.0, y: 5.0, theta: 0.0, linear_velocity: 0.0, angular_velocity: 0.0}"`
